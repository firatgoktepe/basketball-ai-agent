    question: "What video formats are supported?",
    answer:
      "We support MP4 video files up to 500MB. For best compatibility, use H.264 codec with AAC audio. Other formats may work but are not guaranteed.",
  },
  {
    category: "upload",
    question: "Why is my video not loading?",
    answer:
      "Common issues: (1) File is too large (>500MB), (2) Unsupported format (use MP4), (3) Corrupted video file. Try converting your video to MP4 using a tool like HandBrake.",
  },
  {
    category: "processing",
    question: "Why is the scoreboard not being detected?",
    answer:
      "Ensure you've drawn a crop region around the scoreboard. The scoreboard must be clearly visible, well-lit, and readable. Avoid reflections, overlays, or small fonts. Try adjusting the crop area to include only the score numbers.",
  },
  {
    category: "processing",
    question: "Processing is taking too long. How can I speed it up?",
    answer:
      "Try these steps: (1) Reduce sampling rate to 1 FPS, (2) Disable advanced features (Ball Detection, Pose Estimation), (3) Use shorter video clips (2-5 minutes), (4) Close other browser tabs to free up memory.",
  },
  {
    category: "results",
    question: "The detected events are inaccurate. What should I do?",
    answer:
      "Event detection depends on video quality. For better accuracy: (1) Use higher resolution (720p+), (2) Ensure stable camera (no shaking), (3) Good lighting, (4) Clear scoreboard visibility. You can manually correct events in the results view.",
  },
  {
    category: "results",
    question: "Team colors are mixed up. How do I fix this?",
    answer:
      "Team clustering is based on jersey colors. If teams have similar colors or mixed jerseys, the system may struggle. This will be improved in future updates. For now, you can manually adjust team assignments in the event list.",
  },
  {
    category: "performance",
    question: "My browser is freezing during analysis. What's wrong?",
    answer:
      "This may happen on older devices or with very long videos. Solutions: (1) Use a modern browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox), (2) Close other applications, (3) Reduce video length to 5 minutes or less, (4) Disable advanced features, (5) Use 1 FPS sampling rate.",
  },
  {
    category: "performance",
    question: "Do I need a powerful computer to use this?",
    answer:
      "Basic analysis works on most modern computers. For advanced features (Ball Detection, Pose Estimation), a device with WebGPU support and 8GB+ RAM is recommended. The app will automatically recommend optimal settings based on your device.",
